# Compress broker <-> server connection.  If the broker is across a slow link

# Redirection mode. Pedantic redirection always redirects a command when it
# matches a rule in the broker config.  Selective redirection permits
# redirection of commands within a single TCP/IP connection until a command
# has been executed against the master server, at which point all commands
# for the connection are sent to the master server.  Selective redirection is
# the default as it gives GUI users a better experience when replication
# delays might otherwise cause incorrect results to be returned.

# Command policies
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# The general syntax is:
#
# command: <regex pattern>
# {
# 	# Conditions for the command to meet (optional)
#	# Note that with the exception of 'flags', these are regex patterns.
#	# See 'p4 help grep' for an explanation of the regex syntax.
# 	flags     = <required flags>;
# 	args      = <required arguments>;
#	user      = <required user>;
#	workspace = <required client workspace>;
#	prog      = <required client program>;
#	version   = <required version of client program>;
#
#	# What to do with matching commands (required)
#	action = pass | reject | redirect | filter ;
#
#	# How to go about it
#	destination = <altserver>;          # Required for action = redirect
#	execute	= <path to filter program>; # Required for action = filter
#	message = <rejection message>;      # Required for action = reject
#}
#
# Note that when specifying regex patterns, bare strings like 'integ' will also
# match 'integrate'.  To match an exact string, append the beginning/end of line
# anchors.  E.g. '^integ$'.
